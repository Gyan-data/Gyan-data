I am a passionate **Data Engineer** with hands-on experience in building **end-to-end data pipelines** and analytics solutions on the Azure cloud. I work with modern data engineering tools such as **Azure Data Factory, Databricks, PySpark, ADLS Gen2, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Power BI** to transform raw data into meaningful business insights.
